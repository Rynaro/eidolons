## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial nexus scaffold: roster registry, CLI, methodology aggregation, research library, examples.
- `eidolons` CLI with `init`, `add`, `sync`, `list`, `doctor`, `roster` commands.
- Stubs for `remove`, `upgrade` (full implementation in v1.1).
- JSON Schemas for `eidolons.yaml`, `eidolons.lock`, roster entries.
- Prime directives aggregated from project working notes.
- Composition doc with canonical pipeline and handoff contracts.
- Research library with starter BibTeX + production-patterns doc.
- Examples: greenfield, brownfield-rails, solo-atlas.
- GitHub Actions nightly roster health check.
- FORGE promoted to `shipped` in the roster (v1.1.1). Adds the lateral Reasoner to the `full` preset; first stable release with EIIS-1.0 conformant `install.sh`.

### Depends on
- `Rynaro/eidolons-eiis` (separate repo, EIIS v1.0 standard).
- Individual Eidolon repos: atlas, spectra, apivr, idg, forge.

## [1.0.0] — TBD

Initial release target. Release criteria:

- All five Eidolon repos EIIS-1.0 conformant and reachable.
- Nightly `roster-health` workflow green for 7 consecutive days.
- `eidolons init` and `sync` exercised end-to-end in at least one greenfield and one brownfield project.
- `remove` and `upgrade` commands fully implemented.
- Research library populated with ≥10 paper summaries under `research/papers/`.

## Versioning notes

- **Nexus version** bumps when the CLI, roster schema, or composition contracts change.
- **Individual Eidolon versions** are independent — bumping APIVR-Δ doesn't bump the nexus.
- **EIIS version** is independent — EIIS can bump to 1.1 without forcing a nexus bump.

A breaking change to `eidolons.yaml` or `eidolons.lock` schemas requires a **major** nexus bump with a migration guide in this file.
